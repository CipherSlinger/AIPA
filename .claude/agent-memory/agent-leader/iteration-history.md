## Completed Iterations

### Iteration 1 (2026-03-26)
- **Features**: Conversation Export (P0), File Drag-and-Drop (P0)
- **Files**: ChatPanel.tsx (main), globals.css
- **Tester found**: Double-processing bug (textarea onDrop + parent onDrop both firing for image drops). Fixed by removing textarea-level onDrop handler.
- **Key decision**: Export uses CustomEvent pattern for cross-component communication

### Iteration 2 (2026-03-26)
- **Features**: Command Palette (P1), Session Title Auto-Refresh (P1)
- **Files**: CommandPalette.tsx (new), store/index.ts, App.tsx, ChatPanel.tsx, useStreamJson.ts
- **Tester found**: Unused imports (Mic, usePrefsStore). Fixed.
- **Key decision**: CommandPalette communicates with ChatPanel via window CustomEvents (aipa:export, aipa:slashCommand) since they are in different component trees

**Why:** Track these decisions so we don't re-introduce the same bugs or reinvent communication patterns in future iterations.
**How to apply:** When modifying ChatPanel drag-and-drop, check for handler conflicts. When adding cross-component actions, use the CustomEvent pattern established in Iteration 2.
